        <p>My name is Gabriel Bolivar and I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I am studying Web Design and Development and I am currently taking WDD130. I am excited to learn more about web development and to improve my skills in this area. I am also excited to learn more about the different tools and technologies that are used in web development.</p>
        <p>Some of the things that I enjoy doing are playing video games, watching movies, and spending time with my family. I also enjoy learning new things and I am always looking for ways to improve myself. I am excited to see what I can learn in this class and how I can apply it to my future career.</p>
